# Intra-Epithelial Lymphocyte (IEL) Scoring for Predicting Oral Epithelial Dysplasia Malignant Transformation

This repository provides the code for the models used for predicting slide-level malignancy transformation in OED, based on H&E-stained whole-slide images. Link to preprint [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.27.24304967v1).

The first step in this pipeline is to use HoVer-Net+ (see original paper [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/CDPath/html/Shephard_Simultaneous_Nuclear_Instance_and_Layer_Segmentation_in_Oral_Epithelial_Dysplasia_ICCVW_2021_paper.html)) to segment the epithelium and nuclei. We have used the TIAToolbox (see paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00186-5)) implementation of HoVer-Net+ in the below scripts. Next, we have used a Transformer-based model to segment the dyplastic regions of the WSIs (see paper here).

## Set Up Environment

We use Python 3.11 with the [tiatoolbox](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox) package installed. By default this uses PyTorch 2.2.

```
conda create -n odyn python=3.11 cudatoolkit=11.8
conda activate odyn
pip install tiatoolbox
pip uninstall torch
conda install pytorch
pip install h5py
pip install docopt
pip install ml-collections
```

## Repository Structure

Below are the main directories in the repository: 

- `utils/`: scripts for metric, patch generation
- `models/`: model definition

Below are the main executable scripts in the repository:

- `dysplasia_segmentation.py`: transformer inference script
- `epithelium_segmentation.py`: hovernetplus inference script
- `iel_scoring.py`: IEL scoring script
- `viz_iels.py`: Visualise IEL/nuclei and dysplasi regions in cases.


## Inference

### Data Format
Input: <br />
- WSIs supported by [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/), including `svs`, `tif`, `ndpi` and `mrxs`.

Output: <br />
- HoVer-Net nuclei and epithelium segmentations as `dat` and `png` files, respectively. These segmentations are saved at 0.5 mpp resolution. Nuclei `dat` files have a key as the ID for each nucleus, which then contain a dictionary with the keys:
  - 'box': bounding box coordinates for each nucleus
  - 'centroid': centroid coordinates for each nucleus
  - 'contour': contour coordinates for each nucleus 
  - 'prob': per class probabilities for each nucleus
  - 'type': prediction of category for each nucleus
- Transformer dysplasia segmentations as `png` files. These segmentations are saved at 1 mpp resolution.
- IEL scores.

### Model Weights

We use the following weights in this work. If any of the models or checkpoints are used, please ensure to cite the corresponding paper.

- The Transformer model weights (for dyplasia segmentation) obtained from training on the Sheffield OED dataset: [OED Transformer checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EF3ItKmYhtdOy5aV9CJZ0a-g03LDaVy4/view?usp=sharing). 
- The HoVer-Net+ model weights (for epithelium segmentation) obtained from training on the Sheffield OED dataset: [OED HoVer-Net+ checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D2OQhHv-5e9ncRfjv2QM8HE7PAWoS79h/view?usp=sharing). Note, these weights are updated compared to TIAToolbox's and are those obtained in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03757).

### Usage

#### Dysplasia Segmentation with Transformer

The first stage is to run the Transformer-based model on the WSIs to generate dysplasia segmentations. This is relatively fast and is run at 1.0mpp. Note, the `model_checkpoint` is the path to the Transformer segmentation weights available to download from above.

Usage: <br />
```
  python dysplasia_segmentation.py --input_dir="/path/to/input/slides/or/images/dir/" --output_dir="/path/to/transformer/output/dir/" --model_checkpoint="/path/to/transformer/checkpoint/"
```
#### Epithelium Segmentation with HoVer-Net+

The second stage is to run HoVer-Net+ on the WSIs to generate epithelial and nuclei segmentations. This can be quite slow as run at 0.5mpp. Note, the `model_checkpoint` is the path to the HoVer-Net+ segmentation weights available to download from above. However, if none are provided then the default version of HoVer-Net+ used with TIAToolbox, will be used.

Usage: <br />
```
  python epithelium_segmentation.py --input_dir="/path/to/input/slides/or/images/dir/" --output_dir="/path/to/epithelium/output/dir/" --model_checkpoint="/path/to/hovernetplus/checkpoint/"
```

#### Combined Masks

Next, we combine the epithelium mask generated by HoVer-Net+ with the dysplasia map generated by the Transformer. This is to ensure we have conservative dysplastic epithelium masks.

Usage: <br />
```
  python combine_masks.py --input_epith="/path/to/input/epithelium/segmentation/dir/" --input_dysplasia= "/path/to/input/dysplasia/segmentation/dir/" --output_dir="/path/to/combined/mask/output/dir/"
```

#### IEL Scoring

The next stage is to generate IEL scores for each WSI using the nuclei/layer segmentations. Note the `input_mask_dir` is the output directory from the previous step.

Usage: <br />
```
  python iel_scoring.py --input_wsi_dir="/path/to/input/slides/or/images/dir/" --input_mask_dir="/path/to/combined/mask/dir/" --output_dir="/path/to/output/feature/dir/"
```
